Lab - Gather System Information After an Incident

Objectives
●   Collect system information after an incident has occurred.

●   View logs for potential intrusions.

Background / Scenario
When an incident occurs in an organization, people responsible must know how to respond. An organization needs to develop an incident response plan and put together a Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) to manage the response. In this lab, you will gather system information and review logs after an incident has occurred. Doing these tasks immediately after the incident is important because any data residing in RAM will be gone when the system is shut down.

Required Resources
PC with the CSE-LABVM installed in VirtualBox

Instructions
Step 1: Open a terminal window in the CSE-LABVM.
 a.   Launch the CSE-LABVM.

 b.   Double-click the Terminal icon to open a terminal.

Step 2: Collect volatile information of the compromised system.
In this step, you will create a file called report.txt that includes a variety of system information that can be used for incident analysis. This report can then be transferred to a USB drive, emailed, or uploaded to a cloud server to preserve the information. Then the system can be taken down.

 a.   Switch to the root user with the sudo su command. Enter password as the root password.

cisco@labvm:~$ sudo su

[sudo] password for cisco: password

root@labvm:/home/cisco#

 b.   Enter the echo command, and then specify a heading for a newly created file named report.txt. Enter the cat command to review the new file.

root@labvm:/home/cisco# echo Incident Investigator Report > report.txt

root@labvm:/home/cisco# cat report.txt

Incident Investigator Report

root@labvm:/home/cisco#

 c.    Enter the date command and redirect the date and timestamp to the report.txt file. Be sure to use the double angle brackets (>>) to append to the report.txt file. Otherwise, you will replace the previous content.

Note: To better document the content stored in report.txt, use the echo command to add a subheading as shown here for Start Date and Time. Each substep will specify a subheading for you to append before you gather information.

root@labvm:/home/cisco# echo =====Start Date and Time===== >> report.txt

root@labvm:/home/cisco# date >> report.txt

 d.   Enter the uname command to print system information. Use the -a option to append all system information to the report.txt file.

root@labvm:/home/cisco# echo =====System Information===== >> report.txt

root@labvm:/home/cisco# uname -a >> report.txt

 e.   Enter the ifconfig -a command and append all network interface information to the report.txt file.

root@labvm:/home/cisco# echo =====Network Interfaces===== >> report.txt

root@labvm:/home/cisco# ifconfig -a >> report.txt

 f.     The netstat command can collect all the network statistics. Enter the command with the options -ano to collect data on all sockets (-a), IP addresses instead of domain names (-n), and information related to networking times (-o). Append the output to the report.txt file.

root@labvm:/home/cisco# echo =====Network Statistics===== >> report.txt

root@labvm:/home/cisco# netstat -ano >> report.txt

 g.   The ps command reports a snapshot of the current processes running on the system. Enter the command with the options -axu to list every process running on the system (-a and -x) and in a user-oriented format (-u). Append the output to the report.txt file.

root@labvm:/home/cisco# echo =====Processes===== >> report.txt

root@labvm:/home/cisco# ps axu >> report.txt

 h.   The route command lists the routing table currently used by the system. Enter the command with the option -n to list IP addresses instead of trying to determine host names. Append the output to the report.txt file.

root@labvm:/home/cisco# echo =====Routing Table===== >> report.txt

root@labvm:/home/cisco# route -n >> report.txt

 i.     Enter the date command and append the date and timestamp to the end of the file to complete the report.

root@labvm:/home/cisco# echo =====End Date and Time===== >> report.txt

root@labvm:/home/cisco# date >> report.txt

 j.     Use the cat command and pipe the output to the less command to view report.txt one page or line at a time. Press the spacebar to scroll down by page or press Enter to scroll down by a single line. Type q when finished.

root@labvm:/home/cisco# cat report.txt | less

Step 3: Analyze different log files and learn their importance.
In addition to capturing information stored in RAM, the system also maintains a variety of logs that you should review after an incident. These log files can also be appended to your report.txt file or stored separately off the system in the event the system needs to be wiped. Logs of particular interest include, but are not limited to, the following:

●   auth.log - logs system authorization information

●   btmp.log - logs failed login attempts

●   wtmp.log - logs who is currently logged into the system

 a.   Use the cat command to view the auth.log and pipe it to the less command. Press the spacebar to scroll down by page or press Enter to scroll down by a single line. Type q when finished. Your output will be different.

root@labvm:/home/cisco# cat /var/log/auth.log | less

 b.   The last command shows a listing of last logged in users. Enter the command with the -f option to specify the log file. The btmp log file shows failed login attempts. Your output will be different.

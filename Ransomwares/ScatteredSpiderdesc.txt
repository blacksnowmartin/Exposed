The code provided is a basic implementation of the Scattered Spider Ransomware. It includes two main functions:

encryptFile: This function takes a filename as input, opens the file in read/write mode, reads its contents, encrypts the data using a simple XOR encryption technique, and writes the encrypted data back to the file.

main: In the main function, a target file (important_data.txt) is specified, and the encryptFile function is called to encrypt the contents of this file. Finally, a success message is printed to indicate that the file has been encrypted.

This code snippet demonstrates a simplistic ransomware encryption process for educational purposes only. It is crucial to note that the creation and distribution of ransomware are illegal and unethical. It is essential to use programming skills for positive and lawful purposes.
